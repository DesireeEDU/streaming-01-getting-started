## Prerequisites

You should have these downloaded and installed on your machine:

1. Python 3.10 or higher
1. VS Code
1. VS Code Extension: Python
1. Git (configured with user.name and user.email - the same email you use for GitHub)

## Explore & Execute Project Scripts

With our project repository folder open in VS Code, and having confirmed that we can execute a Python script successfully, it's time to explore. 

Open, read, and run each project script (each file will have a .py extension) in order.

You don't need to fully understand the code yet. 
Instead, read the code and try to figure out what each file is doing.

When you finish, you'll have an idea of some things possible using just the Python standard library. 
You'll have generated several new data files.
The streaming process will run continuously for quite a while. 
Read the comments in the file to learn how to stop the process.

Important: 

- If Mac/Linux, change `python` to `python3` in the commands below.
- In Windows, you might try `py` instead of `python`.
- Wait for each script to finish. Did you generate a new datafile? What is the name?

```shell
python process_batch_A.py
```

```shell
python process_batch_B.py
```

```shell
python process_batch_C.py
```

```shell
python process_streaming_0.py
```
 
✔️ Make sure your scripts complete successfully. 
If not, post screenshots and the text of any error messages in the discussion.
